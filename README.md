# shmelectronics
I will put my sketches for fun little electronics projects into this repository!! and hopefully cease my habit of duplicating my .ino files 20x and calling that version control!!

## Current inventory... 
- #### some ESP32 Web Server + Web Interface code
  an example that connects to a wifi network (ie your iPhone hotspot), an example that sets up a Local Area Network that other devices can connect to, and an example of the latter that I used for an interactive "binary programming" demo with some cooool students where they could go to the website, enter a command, to make lights turn on/servos sweep/ etc.
- #### my train code
  (code that ran on an Arduino UNO inside my BART train costume, connected to 2 WS2812B RGB LED chips in the headlights and a MAX7219 LED Scrolling sign, 3 button switches (for turning the sign on, turning on/ changing the headlight colors, and resetting the device) a 9V battery for powering the LED sign, and a phone charger battery pack to power the UNO)
